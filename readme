# News App Native

This is a native Android news application.

## Implementation Choices

* **Architecture:** The app follows a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture for a clear separation of concerns.
* **Dependency Injection:** Hilt is used for dependency injection to improve code testability and maintainability.
* **Networking:**Retrofit is used for making API calls to fetch news data.
* **Data Persistence:** Room is used for local storage of data, such as bookmarks.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Kotlin Coroutines are used for handling asynchronous tasks like network requests and database operations.
* **State Management:**  LiveData is used for managing UI state and observing data changes.
* **Testing:**
    * Unit tests are written for DB and APIs.

## Code Structure

* **`ui`:** Contains Activities, Adapters, View Models and UI-related logic.
* **`data`:** Contains data sources (remote and local), repositories, and data models.
* **`domain`:** Contains use cases, business logic, and interactors.
* **`di`:** Contains dependency injection modules.
